# Python / Github Actions Pipeline

## Pipeline
The main goal of this project was to ensure continuous integration and deployment of docerized applications to AWS ECS Fargate service.

I chose Fargate instead of managed EC2 instance just for the simplicity 

## Application
A small Python webapplication written using Flask. Application gets basic information about current and former NBA players based on user's input. Code is short and simple, developing this app was not a goal of this project - I only cared about automation.

Application makes use of an amazing API from: https://app.balldontlie.io/
